			We take great pride in our teachers here at Young Notes. Each one is an accomplished musician in his 
			or her own right, and a great teacher too! Most of our faculty are basic level tuition teachers. 
			Faculty teaching at the master level is also available. Read their biographies in the box at the right. 
			Don't be a stranger! Prospective students and their parents are always welcome to join us for one-on-one 
			interviews and a free "get to know you" session of instruction. Contact the school for more details.
